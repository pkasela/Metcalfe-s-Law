# Metcalfe-s-Law
This a repository for the paper we were writing about the Metcalfe's Law and Kurzweil Law.

The Metcalfe's Law states that the value of a network with n user grows like n^2.
In this paper we discuss an criticize initially the Metcalfe's Law stating how it might be a very optimistic law,
so we presented a more realistic estimate of this law, the Ozlyzko's Law which states that the growth isn't n^2
but n*log(n). We prove both laws and other laws such as Sarnoff's Law for broadcasting network.
We present also the socio-economic implications of this law. As one of the examples we show the facebook example, in this
case presented by Metcalfe himself to show how his law be still valid.

In the last section we show a mathematical model of the Kurzweil Law, and criticize how it might be wrong to try to 
predict the future so far.
