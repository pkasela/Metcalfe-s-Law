\part*{Socio-Economic Interpretation.}
The formula of Metcalfe's Law presupposes that each node is linked with the whole net and all connections have the same importance.
Those presuppositions are considered too strong, so new mathematical laws have been presented; but empirical studies have demonstrated the veracity of Metcalfe's Law in social networks. \newline
Presuppositions of Metcalfe's Law are not satisfied even when its veracity is demonstrated; however, in a social environment other presuppositions are to be considered: user's behaviour and user's \textit{saturation}; moreover, algorithms used to improve links quality and the possibility for people to aggregate may be enough to make the value of the whole network increase according to a quadratic function $n^2$. \newline
In general, all laws that try to estimate the value as a function of the number of nodes do not consider that the network in made by people connected, and so human behaviour must be considered. \newline

Estimating the value of a net is important in an economic contest: costs and earnings are the base of any business. Costs are not considered just in terms of money, but also as resources needed to run the business, like server's disk space and computational power.
Decisions concerning the server depends on the costs of the network; and since it is necessary to run the business, estimation can not be lower than real costs: the service risks to be interrupted and the value of the network drastically decreases to zero. \newline

\section{Economic Evaluation of a Net.}
In general, to a company, nets are not the product but just a distribution channel: in this case, the net can be evaluated according to earnings coming from it; in this case the model is just linear.
This is just a simple and empirical way to estimate a value, but works for big companies that offer a payment service. \newline
A generalization of this criterion is to calculate the sum of value exchanged between each nodes; this can be easily done in e-commerce sites or for a transport net. \newline%\footfullcite{Weinman}.

Metcalfe's Law is necessary when no or small data are available, so the value can not be known and can be just estimate.
This is the case of advertisement selling: the value of the space is not known, but companies have to accord a price according to the distribution that the advert may have in the network. \newline
 
Estimating the value is important when balance-sheet is compiled or budget is calculated. In addiction, according to Italian's Law, the balance-sheet must be \textit{prudent}, so costs can not be under-estimated.
With this in mind, Metcalfe's Law is correctly adopted: if costs follow a $o(n^2)$ model, laws would not be not broken; in fact, it is empirically demonstrated that costs of a social media follows this law.
Using the same criterion, if no data are available, earnings are not well estimated: is more prudent using a lower formula, like $n \cdot \log{n}$. \newline

\section{Net saturation.}
In a network, often nodes are normal people: in a finished time, not all value can be extracted.
This means that a person has no time to communicate with and may not receives all communications from the whole net.
The term \textit{saturation} is used to mean that a person can not exchange the maximum value with the net due to the mole of information that receives.
In addition, not all communications have the same value: user is covered with information, for the most useless, that can not manage.

\section{Math Section[We will modify the title] We will add images later too}
We start with the Sarnoff's rule, which is pretty simple. It states that the value of a broadcast network is linearly proportional to it's users, so basically if we have $n$ users we will have the value growth is $V \cdot n$ where $V$ is the value of a connection. A simple example would be a radio or companies like Netflix.
\newline IMAGE \newline
\textit{Proof} : The proof is trivial since we have n users connected to single node which is considered to be the streamer. Assume every connection has value $V$ then we will just sum $V$ $n$-times obtaining value is $\sum_{i=1}^{n} V = V \cdot n$ \hfill $\square$
\newline
\newline
Next is Metcalfe's Law, which states that the growth rate is proportional to the square of number of users.\newline
\textit{Proof} : The idea is similar to the Sarnoff's law: fix one of the n nodes we can see that using Sarnoff's law (or common sense) we have $n-1$ connection
IMAGE \newline
assuming that every connection has value $V$ we have that from the first node we are gaining $V \cdot (n - 1)$ value, now fix a second node we obtain again $n-1$ connections but remember that we have already considered the connection with the first node so we have $n-2$ connections,\newline
IMAGE \newline
thus we generate $V \cdot (n - 2)$ value so proceeding this way and summing all the values we have that the total value is a $\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} V \cdot i = V \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i = V \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \propto \frac{V}{2} n^2$  \hfill $\square$
\newline IMAGE \newline

Now we try to prove a general formula, not assuming that every connection has the same value and n is large enough otherwise as we said Metcalfe's Law is the optimal solution, which is a strong hypothesis and cannot be satisfied if the number of users a very high simply because we cannot one of them to all, for example if we were to have only 10 users on a social media then most probably all of them will connect between themselves without "discrimination" but if we were to have millions of users, without using some algorithm to extrapolate value out of them, we cannot have that these millions (it would be $\propto$ million$^2$ using Metcalfe's law) of connection will have the same value, but since the human behavior on a large scale is similar, just see the Big Data mindset, we might use the following generalization:
fix a user and sort the other user on the value of connection and call the values $V_1$ for the first connection, $V_2$ for second, ... , $V_{n-1}$ for the last one.
\newline IMAGE \newline
Since we assumed this to be true for every user, we have that the total value of network is, like before since we are trying to find the proportionality we can take the connection 2 times, $\propto n \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} V_n$, we can see if we have $V_{n-1}=...=V_2=V_1$ the Metcalfe hypothesis we have the $ \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} V_n = n\cdot V$ thus the network value is $\propto V \cdot n^2$ which was the Metcalfe's Law.
Now we can see that the network value us based on the series $\sum V_i$ if number of users $n$ is big enough, so the series converges we will have that the value connection is linear, if it diverges we will need to study the asymptotic behavior of the series.
%I need here to use the harmonic series & prove Reed's Law and criticize it.
%We will add the IMAGES later bcoz I don't know if we can do it on github
